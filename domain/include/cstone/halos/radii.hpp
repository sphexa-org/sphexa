/*! @brief Compute the halo radius of each node in the given octree
 *
 * This is the maximum distance beyond the node boundaries that a particle outside the
 * node could possibly interact with.
 *
 * TODO: Don't calculate the maximum smoothing length, calculate the maximum distance by
 *       which any of the particles plus radius protrude outside the node.
 *
 * @tparam Tin              float or double
 * @tparam Tout             float or double, usually float
 * @tparam KeyType          32- or 64-bit unsigned integer type for SFC codes
 * @tparam IndexType        integer type for local particle array indices, 32-bit for fewer than 2^32 local particles
 * @param[in]  tree         octree nodes given as SFC codes of length @a nNodes+1
 *                          This function does not rely on octree invariants, sortedness of the nodes
 *                          is the only requirement.
 * @param[in]  nNodes       number of nodes in tree
 * @param[in]  particleKeys sorted SFC particle keys
 * @param[in]  input        Radii per particle, i.e. the smoothing lengths in SPH, length = particleKeys.size()
 * @param[out] output       Radius per node, length = @a nNodes
